[85930-610858]Households that are displaced or those separated from each other were found to be the most impacted, with around one in every two such households food insecure. One in five of the surveyed households had inadequate food consumption at the time of the survey. (World Food Programme, UN Country Team in Ukraine, Ukraine Food Security Report, 13/05/2022)

[85930-610870]Considering the highly fluid and rapidly developing context in Ukraine, the food security situation is likely to continue to evolve over time. Continuous monitoring will be carried out to capture such changes as the situation unfolds. Two in every three households reported relying on less preferred and less expensive food (World Food Programme, UN Country Team in Ukraine, Ukraine Food Security Report, 13/05/2022)

[85930-610873] [Kiev City] Markets are impacted by the war, and predominantly in the east. In the northern and eastern oblasts, up to a third of people reported that shops in their local markets were partially or fully closed at the time of the survey. More than half of respondents in Kyiv city and the north, east, and south oblasts reported that some products were scarce, mentioning food stuffs such as grains, bread, dairy, and meat. (World Food Programme, UN Country Team in Ukraine, Ukraine Food Security Report, 13/05/2022)

[85930-610883] [Migrants, refugees, stateless, IDPS] Since the onset of the war on 24 February 2022, the humanitarian situation in Ukraine has continued to deteriorate. The war has pushed millions of people from their homes, creating the fastest-growing displacement crisis since the second world war. Eastern and southern oblasts in Ukraine continue to see active fighting. The destruction of civilian infrastructure is affecting essential services such as electricity, heating, and clean water and disrupting access to food and healthcare. (World Food Programme, UN Country Team in Ukraine, Ukraine Food Security Report, 13/05/2022)

[85930-610891]At the national level, one in five of the interviewed households had inadequate current food consumption at the time of the survey. When combining this with households’ use of coping strategies such as borrowing money or leaving valuable assets behind when displacing, as well as relying on erratic income sources or total income loss, food insecurity estimates rise to approximately one in three, nationwide. It is important to note that out of the 33% estimated to be food insecure according to the rCARI scale, only 5% were found to be severely food insecure, meaning facing extreme food consumption gaps or extreme loss of livelihood assets. (World Food Programme, UN Country Team in Ukraine, Ukraine Food Security Report, 13/05/2022)

[85930-610954] [Migrants, refugees, stateless, IDPS, Luhanska; Kiev City] Analyzing results by oblast, Luhanska had the highest share of households with inadequate food consumption (47%). Meanwhile, Khersonska and Donetska oblasts had around one-third of households with poor or borderline food consumption. Web survey results have echoed the above findings from the phone survey, with nearly 40% of IDPs residing in the eastern and southern areas consuming one meal or less the day prior, followed by 35% of IDPs in Kyiv (World Food Programme, UN Country Team in Ukraine, Ukraine Food Security Report, 13/05/2022)

[85930-610957] [Female head of household] Households with a female decision-maker were more likely to have a poor or borderline consumption (23 %), compared to 19 % of households with a male decision-maker. Households mostly bought their food with cash (69 %), followed by consuming their own production (17 %), and credit purchases (6 %). (World Food Programme, UN Country Team in Ukraine, Ukraine Food Security Report, 13/05/2022)

[85930-610976] [Female head of household] Findings have shown that a higher percentage of households with male decision-makers continue to generate income from professional and skilled labour wages (38%), compared to females (30%). A significant difference was observed among pensioners as 35% of households with female decision-makers rely on pensions compared to only 21% of households with male decision-makers.

[85930-610986] [Kiev City] In Kyiv city and the eastern and northern areas, this disruption appeared more pervasive, with around one in four respondents reporting that stores were not operating regularly in their neighbourhoods at the time of the survey, and another 20% of respondents reported that the stores were only partially functioning (World Food Programme, UN Country Team in Ukraine, Ukraine Food Security Report, 13/05/2022)

[85930-612000] [Kharkivska; Luhanska; Khersonska; Sumska] The survey findings also reflect increasing prices. Three quarters of all respondents reported having experienced significant increases in prices in the two weeks before the survey. Respondents in the eastern, southern, and northern parts of the country were more likely to report price increases, with the figure going up to 90% in the Sumska oblast and over 80% in Donetska, Luhanska, Odeska, Khersonska, Kharkivska, and Chernihivska oblasts. According to data from the Ukrainian Statistical Service, bread prices went up by 3.5-4.3% in March nationwide, with increases up to around 30 percent in the Kherson oblast.

[85930-632237] [Luhans'k; Kherson; Donets'k; Zaporizhzhya] Oblasts in the eastern and southern parts of the country were found to have the highest estimate levels of food insecurity, with one in every two households being food insecure. (World Food Programme, UN Country Team in Ukraine, Ukraine Food Security Report, 13/05/2022)

[85923-607141]Similarly, food prices rose by 84%, their largest increase in a comparable period since 2008. These increases in prices are having major humanitarian and economic impacts and exacerbating food insecurity and inflation in many countries.

[85922-609169] [Extreme poverty, insecure & informal work/incomes] The poverty and social impacts of the war will be massive. Simulations using the most recent macroeconomic projection show that the share of the population with incomes below the actual Subsistence Minimum (the national poverty line) may reach 70 % in 2022, up from 18 % in 2021. In the absence of a massive post-war support package, this indicator would still be higher than 60% by 2025. Based on the international upper middle income poverty line (US$5.5 a day), poverty is projected to increase to 19.8 % in 2022, up from 1.8 percent in 2021, with an additional 59 % of people being vulnerable to falling into poverty. (World Bank, UN Country Team in Ukraine, Macro Poverty Outlook for Ukraine, 23/04/2022)

[85914-632031]Ukraine’s critical human capital, a source of future growth, is at risk from the war’s interruption of learning. The priority is to keep students connected to the educational system so that they can complete the school year. This also requires that educators remain accessible and available to students, including through online learning. (World Bank, UN Country Team in Ukraine, Relief, Recovery and Resilient Reconstruction Supporting Ukraine's Immediate and Medium- Term Economic Needs, 13/05/2022)

[85914-632078]Depending on the duration of the war, physical availability of food will deteriorate further, while rising inflation will severely affect the welfare of those already most vulnerable prior to the crisis (pensioners, people living on social assistance, and low-paid employees). In areas affected by active warfare, destruction of private property is widespread, causing people to lose housing, often their main asset. The rapid assessment by the World Bank estimated about US$19 billion in conflict-related damages of residential buildings. These will require repair or reconstruction – and the destruction has already caused millions to be displaced.
